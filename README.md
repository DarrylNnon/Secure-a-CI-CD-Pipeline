# Secure a CICD Pipeline
*Steps*:
     1. Set up a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins or GitLab CI.
     2. Integrate static application security testing (SAST) with tools like SonarQube.
     3. Add dynamic application security testing (DAST) using OWASP ZAP.
     4. Implement container image scanning (e.g., Trivy) to scan for vulnerabilities.
     5. Automate secret scanning with tools like Trufflehog or GitGuardian.


Here's a step-by-step guide for setting up a secure CI/CD pipeline with an emphasis on real-world security practices:

#1. Set Up a CI/CD Pipeline
   - *Goal*: Establish a continuous integration and deployment process to automatically build, test, and deploy code securely.
   Steps:
   - Choose a CI/CD Tool: Install and configure Jenkins, GitLab CI, or another CI/CD tool of my choice.
       Example: For Jenkins, install it on your server and configure web access to manage your pipeline jobs.
   - Connect Your Repository: Integrate the CI/CD tool with your code repository (e.g., GitHub or GitLab).
       Example: In Jenkins, set up a new project, link it to your Git repository, and configure webhook triggers for automatic build triggers on push events.

# 2. Integrate Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
   - Goal: Detect vulnerabilities in the code before it is compiled or deployed by using static code analysis.
   
   Steps:
   - Install a SAST Tool: Use SonarQube or a similar tool to analyze code for security issues.
   - Integrate with CI/CD: Configure your pipeline to trigger SonarQube analysis on each commit or pull request.
      Example: Add a SonarQube stage in your Jenkinsfile to automatically run the scan after the build.
   - Review Findings: Ensure that security vulnerabilities and code quality issues are reviewed and addressed.

# 3. Add Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)
   - Goal: Simulate real-world attacks on a running application to identify vulnerabilities from an external attacker’s perspective.
   
   Steps:
   - Set Up OWASP ZAP: Deploy OWASP ZAP, an open-source DAST tool, to scan your application.
   - Configure Scans in the Pipeline: Set up ZAP to run automated scans on your application’s test or staging environment.
     - Example: Add a DAST stage in your CI/CD pipeline to launch ZAP and test for common vulnerabilities like SQL injection, XSS, and CSRF.
   - Analyze Results: Review the ZAP report after each pipeline run to fix critical vulnerabilities before moving to production.

### **4. Implement Container Image Scanning**
   - **Goal**: Ensure that container images are free from known vulnerabilities before they are deployed.
   
   **Steps:**
   - **Use a Scanning Tool**: Integrate Trivy or a similar tool for scanning Docker images.
   - **Add Scanning to the Pipeline**: Include a Trivy scan stage in your CI/CD pipeline to check images as they are built.
     - *Example*: Configure Trivy to run after the Docker image is built, checking for vulnerabilities at OS and application levels.
   - **Set Thresholds**: Define acceptable vulnerability thresholds and fail the pipeline if critical issues are found.

---

### **5. Automate Secret Scanning**
   - **Goal**: Detect and prevent accidental exposure of secrets (API keys, passwords) in your code repository.
   
   **Steps:**
   - **Use a Secret Scanning Tool**: Deploy Trufflehog, GitGuardian, or another tool to scan for secrets in your code.
   - **Integrate into the Pipeline**: Add a secret-scanning stage in your CI/CD pipeline to check for sensitive data on each commit.
     - *Example*: Configure GitGuardian to scan code pushed to your repository and notify your team of any detected secrets.
   - **Implement Remediation**: Educate developers on best practices for managing secrets, such as using environment variables or secure vaults (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).

---

### **6. Configure Notifications and Logging**
   - **Goal**: Ensure that key stakeholders are informed of critical findings and maintain a secure audit trail of pipeline activities.
   
   **Steps:**
   - **Set Up Notifications**: Configure your CI/CD tool to send notifications on critical pipeline stages (e.g., security test failures) to Slack, email, or other channels.
   - **Enable Logging**: Ensure that pipeline logs are securely stored for future auditing and troubleshooting.
     - *Example*: In Jenkins, use the Audit Trail plugin to log user actions or integrate with centralized logging solutions like ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) stack.

---

### **7. Test and Refine the Pipeline**
   - **Goal**: Verify that the CI/CD pipeline runs smoothly and effectively identifies security issues.
   
   **Steps:**
   - **Run a Full Pipeline Test**: Push code updates and monitor each stage to ensure that scans and notifications work as expected.
   - **Address Any Issues**: Review logs, tweak configurations, and fine-tune thresholds or exceptions as needed.
   - **Continuous Improvement**: Periodically assess the pipeline’s effectiveness and update tools or configurations as new vulnerabilities or security requirements emerge.

---

### **8. Document and Share the Pipeline Process**
   - **Goal**: Provide clear documentation to help team members understand the CI/CD pipeline, including security configurations and remediation steps.
   
   **Steps:**
   - **Write a README**: Include details on pipeline stages, tool configurations, and best practices.
   - **Provide Training**: Offer guidance to team members on responding to security alerts and maintaining best practices.
   - **Review and Update Regularly**: Ensure documentation is kept up-to-date as the pipeline evolves.

---

By following these steps, you’ll create a secure CI/CD pipeline that not only automates builds and deployments but also incorporates security checks to protect your application and infrastructure in real-time. This setup is highly applicable in real-world scenarios, as security in CI/CD pipelines has become a standard for protecting sensitive environments.

 sudo tail -f /opt/sonarqube/logs/sonar.log
 
 7 - Access the SonarQube UI
 http://<IP>:9000
 
 2 - COnfigure Sonarqube
 
 	* log in with credentials (admin/admin) and change the password
 	* Create a new project in SonarQube for my application
 	
 	* Generate a projet token for authentication. I will need this token to integrate SonarQube with jenkins
 	
 	
 3 - Integrate SOnarQube with Jenkins
 	Goal: Set up sonarqube as part of my jenkins CI/CD pipeline.
 	step: 
 		1- install sonarqube scanner plugin in jenkins:
 		* Go to manage jenkins > manage plugin
 		* search and install SonarQube scanner plugin
 		
 	        2- Configure SonarQube in jenkins:
 * Go to manage jenkins > configure system.
 * scroll down to sonarqube server and add a new SonarQube server with:
   - Name: E.G., SonarQube
   - Server URL: http://<server-ip>:9000
   - server authentication token: Use the token created in SonarQube for my project.
   
   3- Set up Sonarqube scanner:
   - In jenkins, go to  Manage jenkins > Global Tool configuration
   - Scroll to SonarQube Scanner and add the installation for SonarQube Scanner.
   
   
  4- Add SonarQube Analysis to my CI/CD pipeline
  	 Goal: Configure my jenkins pipeline to trigger SonarQube analysis on each commit or pull request.
  	
  	Steps:
  	
  	1- Modify Jenkinsfile to include SonarQube stage :
  	  * In my project's jenkinsfile, i add a stage for SonarQUbe analysis
  	  This runs a static analysis on the codebase after the build stage.
  	
  pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                // Your build steps here
            }
        }
        stage('SonarQube Analysis') {
            steps {
                withSonarQubeEnv('SonarQube') { // Use the configured SonarQube server
                    sh 'sonar-scanner \
                        -Dsonar.projectKey=your_project_key \
                        -Dsonar.sources=src \
                        -Dsonar.host.url=http://<server-ip>:9000 \
                        -Dsonar.login=your_token'
                }
            }
        }
    }
    post {
        always {
            // Add any steps for notifications or reporting
        }
    }
}
	  
	  2- Trigger the pipeline:
	   * Each time code is committed, jenkins will automatically trigger a build, followed by SonarQUbe analysis to identify potential issues.
	   
	   4- Review SonarQube findings
    GOAL: Detect and address vulnerabilities before deployment.
    steps:
      1- View Analysis Results:
      -> Go to SonarQube, open my project, and review the issues tab for security vulnerabilities, code smells, and bugs.
      
      2- Set Quality Gates:
      -> In SonarQube, i configure Quality Gates to define conditions under which a build passes or fails based on issues found. This helps enforce code quality standards.
      
      3- Iterate and improve:
      -> I ensure that identified issues are addressed by my development team and re-scan the code to verify fixes.
      
      III- Add Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)
GOAL: Simulate real-world attacks on a running application to identify vulnerabilities from an external attacker's perpective.
      
      Overview of key steps:
 1- Deploy OWASP ZAP in Docker for easy setup and consistency accross environments.
 2- Integrate OWASP ZAP in the CI/CD pipeline to automate scans.
 3- Analyse scan Results and set up alerts for critical vulnerabilities.
 
  Step 1: Deploy OWASP ZAP in Docker
Using  Docker for owasp zap simplifies setup and ensures that my scans are consistent accross different environments.

	1- Install Docker (if not already install)
sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker.io -y

	2- Run OWASP ZAP Docker Container: Pull and run the ZAP Docker image to perform a full scan of my application. This will create an HTML report of vulnerability
	
	-> docker pull owasp/zap2docker-stable or docker pull owasp/2zapdocker-weekly 
	
	troubleshooting: run the owasp zap container:
Once the image is pulled, i can run it as before.

docker run -v $(pwd):/zap/wrk -t owasp/zap2docker-weekly zap"-full-scan.py -t TARGET_URL -r zap_report.html

 3- Run the ZAP scan: Adjust the target URL to match my application's test or staging environment URL. Replace TARGET_URL with my application's URL:
 
 -> docker run -v $(pwd): /zap/wrk -t owasp/zap2docker-weekly zap-full-scan.py -t TARGET_URL -r zap_report.html
 
 * This command initiates a full scan, with zap_report.html as the output report in my current directory
 
 * Note: Running ZAP in -daemon mode for long-running scans is also possible, but a full scan (as shown above) is suitable for most integration cases.
 
 Step 2: Integrate OWASP ZAP in the CI/CD Pipeline
 Add owasp zap to my pipeline to automate the scan process.Here's how to integrate it within a jenkins pipeline as an example.
 
 Jenkins Pipeline Example
 1- In jenkins, set up the environment variables:
 
 environment {
 	TARGET_URL = 'http://my-application-url'
 }
 
 2 - Define pipeline stages: Use Docker to run Zap as a stage within my jenkins pipeline. Here's an example:
 
 pipeline {
    agent any
    environment {
        TARGET_URL = 'http://your-application-url'
    }

    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                echo 'Building the application...'
                // Add your build steps here
            }
        }

        stage('DAST: OWASP ZAP Scan') {
            steps {
                echo 'Running OWASP ZAP Scan...'

                script {
                    // Run ZAP with Docker to scan the target URL
                    sh """
                    docker run -v $WORKSPACE:/zap/wrk -t owasp/zap2docker-stable zap-full-scan.py -t $TARGET_URL -r zap_report.html
                    """
                }
            }
        }

        stage('Review DAST Report') {
            steps {
                echo 'Reviewing ZAP Report for vulnerabilities...'
                archiveArtifacts artifacts: 'zap_report.html'
            }
        }

        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                echo 'Deploying the application...'
                // Add your deploy steps here
            }
        }
    }

    post {
        always {
            echo 'Pipeline finished.'
        }
    }
}


 3- Result archival:
 	* Archive the zap_report.html in jenkins to store scan with result with each pipeline run. This way, report are always accessible and can be reviewd for future reference.
 	
 4- Set up Alert for Critical vulnerabilities (optional but recommended):
 
 Goal: Setting up alerts for critical vulnerabilities after an owasp zap scan is a smart way to ensure that only secure code proceeds to production.Here's a step-by step approach using zap-cli (an unofficial CLI for owasp zap) to parse and evaluate the zap scan results:
 
 step 1- Install zap-cli
 -> if zap-cli is not already installed, i can install it using pip. Ensure pip is installed on my system, and then run:
    * pip install zap-cli
    
   step 2: Run the owasp zap scan and generate a report
 Make sure i configure the scan to output results in JSON format for easier parsing. For example:
 -> docker run -v $(pwd):/zap/wrk -t owasp/zap2docker-weekly zap-full-scan.py -t TARGET_URL -J zap_report.json
 
 Replace TARGET_URL with the URL of my application. ThiS command will generate a JSON report name zap_report.json in the current directory.
 
 step 3: Parse and Evaluate the Report with zap-cli
 
 After the scan completes, use zap-cli to parse the report and trigger alerts based on the severity of the vulnerabilities found.
 	1* start zap Daemon mode
 First, start zap in daemon mode if am not already running it:
 -> docker run -u zap -p 8080:8080 -i owasp/zap2docker-weekly zap.sh -daemon -host 0.0.0.0 -port 8080
 
 	2* Run zap-cli Against the scan Results i can then set up zap-cli to analyse the results. I configure it to fail based on vulnerabilities severity (e.g., failing on any vulnerabilities at medium or higher severity):
 	
 	zap-cli --zap-url http://localhost --port 8080 quick-scan --self-contained TARGET_URL
zap-cli --zap-url http://localhost --port 8080 report -o zap_report.json
zap-cli --zap-url http://localhost --port 8080 alerts -l Medium

 - The alert flag with -l Medium will output any medium or higher severity alerts, allowing me to set up custom logic in the CI/CD pipeline to handle failures.
 
 4- Automate Pass/Fail Logic in CI/CD
 In my CI/CD pipeline, i can use a script that:
 	* RUns zap-cli and parses the alerts.
 	* Fails the pipeline if vulnerabilies of critical level are detected.
 	
 Here's an example script i can include in my pipeline configuration file:
 
 # Run OWASP ZAP scan and generate report
docker run -v $(pwd):/zap/wrk -t owasp/zap2docker-weekly zap-full-scan.py -t TARGET_URL -J zap_report.json

# Start ZAP in daemon mode
docker run -u zap -p 8080:8080 -i owasp/zap2docker-weekly zap.sh -daemon -host 0.0.0.0 -port 8080

# Run zap-cli to check for critical vulnerabilities
CRITICAL_VULNERABILITIES=$(zap-cli --zap-url http://localhost --port 8080 alerts -l Medium | grep -c "Critical")

if [ "$CRITICAL_VULNERABILITIES" -gt 0 ]; then
    echo "Critical vulnerabilities found! Failing the pipeline."
    exit 1
else
    echo "No critical vulnerabilities found. Continuing pipeline."
fi


 Step 5: Set Up Alerts
 I can integrate with notification systems like slack, Teams, or email for critical vulnerabilities by sending an alert if the script exits with a non-zero status.
 
 Here's is a step-by-step guide to setting up SLACK notification in this context, but similar principles apply to other platform as well.
 
 -> Prerequisites for Slack Alerts
 1- Create a Slack Webhook URL:
 	* Go to my SlACK Workspace and create an Incoming webhook.
 	* Select the channel where i want to receive alerts and generate a webhook URL. This URL will be used to send messages to my Slack channel.
 	
 Step-by-step Integration with Slack:
 
 1- Add Slack Webhook URL to CI/cd Environment variables:
 
 * Store the Slack webhook URL securely in my CI/CD tool(jenkins) as an environment variable named SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL for easy reference.
 
 2- Modify my pipeline script to send Alerts on Failure:
 
 * Update the script to check for critical vulnerabilities, and if any are found, send an alert to slack.
 
 Here's an example Bash script that run the OWASP ZAP scan, checks for critical vulnerabilities, and sends a Slack notification if any are found.
 
 # Define Slack alert function
send_slack_alert() {
    curl -X POST -H 'Content-type: application/json' --data "{\"text\":\"Critical vulnerabilities detected in OWASP ZAP scan for project!\"}" $SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL
}

# Run OWASP ZAP scan and generate report
docker run -v $(pwd):/zap/wrk -t owasp/zap2docker-weekly zap-full-scan.py -t TARGET_URL -J zap_report.json

# Start ZAP in daemon mode
docker run -u zap -p 8080:8080 -i owasp/zap2docker-weekly zap.sh -daemon -host 0.0.0.0 -port 8080

# Run zap-cli to check for critical vulnerabilities
CRITICAL_VULNERABILITIES=$(zap-cli --zap-url http://localhost --port 8080 alerts -l Medium | grep -c "Critical")

# Check for critical vulnerabilities and send Slack alert if any found
if [ "$CRITICAL_VULNERABILITIES" -gt 0 ]; then
    echo "Critical vulnerabilities found! Sending Slack alert."
    send_slack_alert
    exit 1  # Exit with non-zero status to fail the pipeline
else
    echo "No critical vulnerabilities found. Continuing pipeline."
fi

Explanation of the script
   * Send_slack_alert(): A function that posts a message to my slack channel via the webhook URL.
   * CRITICAL_VULNERABILITIES Check: if the script finds any critical vulnerabilities, it calls send_slack_alert to post a message to Slack, then exits with status 1 to fail the pipeline.
   
   * Exit status: The Script exits with a non-zero status if vulnerabilities are found, wich will mark the CI/CD pipeline as failed.
   
   Example Slack Message Customization:
 To add more detail in the Slack message, customize the send_slack_alert function like this:
 send_slack_alert() {
    curl -X POST -H 'Content-type: application/json' \
    --data "{\"text\":\"Critical vulnerabilities detected in OWASP ZAP scan for *Project Name* on *$(date)*.\nPipeline has been stopped. Immediate action is required.\"}" \
    $SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL
}

Using Other Notification systems:

If i want to use email or other notification tools, i replace the send_slack_alert function with an appropriate command or API call for the chosen system, such as sendmail for email or webhook URL for Teams.
 
 
 This set up will ensure that my pipeline only passes if no critical vulnerabilities are found, adding an extra layer of security to deployment process.
 
 
  IV: IMPLEMENT CONTAINER IMAGE SCANNING
  GOAL: Ensure that container images are free from known vulnerabilities before they are deployed.
  
 I am going to use TRIVY in my CI/CD pipeline.
 
 PREREQUISITES:
 - Docker: Ensure Docker is installed on the server or local machine running my CI/CD pipeline.
 - Trivy: Install Trivy, an open-source vulnerability scanner for Docker images. I can install Trivy either as a standalone binary or within a Docker conTainer.
 
  Step 1: Install Trivy
  
  Option A: Install Trivy as a CLI tool
 Run the following command to install Trivy:
 
 sudo apt-get install wget -y
wget https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy/releases/latest/download/trivy_Linux-64bit.tar.gz
tar zxvf trivy_Linux-64bit.tar.gz
sudo mv trivy /usr/local/bin/

 Option B: Run Trivy in a Docker container
If i want to run Trivy within a Docker container:

-> docker pull aquasec/trivy:latest

step 2: Add Trivy scanning to the CI/CD

Integrate Trivy into my ci.cd pipeline by creating a stage that scans my Docker image  after it's built.

Example CI/CD Configuration

in this example, i will use my jenkins pipeline (jenkinsfile) is used, but similar step  apply for Gitlab ci, Github Actions, etc.

	1- Build Docker Image: Build the Docker image in the pipeline.
	2- Run Trivy scan: Use trivy  to scan the newly built docker image.
	3- Set vulnerability tresholds: Fail the pipeline if any vulnerability are detected.
	
	Here's an example jenkinsfile to demonstrate this process:
	pipeline {
    agent any

    environment {
        IMAGE_NAME = "myapp"
        TAG = "latest"
    }

    stages {
        stage('Build Docker Image') {
            steps {
                script {
                    // Build the Docker image
                    sh "docker build -t ${IMAGE_NAME}:${TAG} ."
                }
            }
        }

        stage('Trivy Scan') {
            steps {
                script {
                    // Run Trivy vulnerability scan on the Docker image
                    sh """
                    docker run --rm -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
                    aquasec/trivy:latest image --exit-code 1 --severity HIGH,CRITICAL ${IMAGE_NAME}:${TAG}
                    """
                }
            }
        }
    }

    post {
        failure {
            echo "Vulnerabilities detected! Please check the Trivy scan report."
        }
    }
}

Explanation of the Jenkinsfile:
 * BUild Docker image: This stage builds the Docker image based on the current project's Dockerfile.
 * Trivy scan: Run Trivy on the built Docker image with the following options:
 
 	# --exit-code: if any high or critical vulnerabilities are found, trivy will exit with code  1, which will fail the jenkins stage.
 	# --severity HIGH,CRITICAL: Only report vulnerabilities with a severity of HIGH OR CRITICAL.
 	
 * Failure Action: If the trivy scan fails(meaning vulnerabilities were found), the pipeline will mark the build as failed, allowing the team to address the issues before proceeding.
 
 Step 3: Define vulnerability thresholds
Adjust the Trivy scan's severity level to match my project's tolerance for vulnerabilities.
	* Severity level:
	  # UNKNOWN: Unknown severity
	  # LOW: Minor vulnerabilities
	  # Medium: Modereate vulnerabilities
	  # HIGH: Major vulnerabilities
	  # CRITICAL: Critical vulnerabilities
	  
to adjust, change --severity HIGh,CRITICAL to adjust to other level based on project needs.

Step 4: View and Review Trivy rEPORTS

When the pipeline runs, Trivy will generate a report in the console output. The team should review the report and address the report and address any detected vulnerabilities before deployment.

For a structure report, i can direct Trivy output to a file:

docker run --rm -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
    aquasec/trivy:latest image --format json --output trivy-report.json --severity HIGH,CRITICAL ${IMAGE_NAME}:${TAG}
    
  This command will save the report in JSON format to trivy-report.json f or easier review and archiving
  
  
  Optional: ADD Notification for Vulnerabilities
  If vulnerabilities are found, consider adding a notification step to alert the via Slack, email, or other communication tools.
  
  Example Slack notification (assuming webhook URL is set in my environment):
  
  post {
    failure {
        echo "Vulnerabilities detected! Notifying team."
        sh """
        curl -X POST -H 'Content-type: application/json' --data '{"text":"Critical vulnerabilities found in Docker image ${IMAGE_NAME}:${TAG}. Please review!"}' $SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL
        """
    }
}

By following these steps, i ensure that my Docker images are scanned for vulnerabilities during the CI/CD process, enabling prompt detection and resolution of critical issues before deployment.

  VI: Automate Secret Scanning.
  Goal: Detect and prevent accidental exposure of secrets (API Keys, passwords) in my code repository.
  
  Here's a step-by-step guide to Add Automated  secret scanning in my CI/CD pipeline to detect and prevent accidental exposure of secrets like API keys, passowords, and other sensitive data in my repository.
  
  Step 1: Choose a secret scanning tool
  
 There are several tools to detect secrets within codebases. For this guide, i will use Trufflehog and GitGuardian as examples:
 	* TRUFFLEHOG : A free, open-source tool that searches for sensitive data in files.
 	* GItGuaRDIAN: A robust, managed solution for secret scanning with notification capabilitties (free for public repositories, with paid plans for repositories).
 	
   Step 2: Install Trufflehog or Set Up GitGuardian
   
   OPtion A: Trufflehog CLi SETUP
   
   1- Install Truffleshog:
      * If i dont have python installed, install it first (apt install python3 -y for Debian-based systems)
      
      * Install Trufflehog using pip:
      
      pip install trufflehog
      
   2- Test Trufflehog on my repository:
   
   Run the following command to test Trufflehog on my codebase locally:
   
   -> trufflehog filesystem --directory=.
 This will scan the current directory for secrets. I can change -- directory to target other paths.
 
 Option B: GitGuardian setup
 
 1- Create a Gitguardian Account: Go to GitGuardian's website and sign up if i haven't already.
 
 2- ObTAIN AN api KEY: iN MY GItguardian dasboard, navigate to settings > API Key and create an API Key. I will use this key to integrate GitGuardian with my CI/CD pipeline.
 
 
  Step 3: Integrate Secret scanning into the CI/CD pipeline
  
  Add a stage to my CI/CD pipeline configuration file(e.g., jenkinsfile, .gitlab-ci.yml, or github-action.yml) to automatically scan for secrets.
  
  Example CI/CD CONFIGURATION FOR SECRET SCANNING
  
  Here's an example for both Jenkins (jenkinsfile) and Github Actions (YAML)
  
  A. Jenkins (Jenkinsfile)
Add a secret scanning stage in my jenkins pipeline.

1- For Trufflehog:
pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        // Other stages (e.g., build, test)
        
        stage('Secret Scanning') {
            steps {
                script {
                    // Run Trufflehog secret scan
                    sh "trufflehog filesystem --directory=."
                }
            }
        }
    }

    post {
        failure {
            echo "Secrets detected! Please review."
        }
    }
}

2- For GitGuardian:
pipeline {
    agent any
    environment {
        GITGUARDIAN_API_KEY = credentials('gitguardian-api-key') // Store API key in Jenkins credentials
    }

    stages {
        stage('Secret Scanning') {
            steps {
                script {
                    // Run GitGuardian scan
                    sh """
                    curl -X POST https://api.gitguardian.com/v1/scan \
                    -H "Authorization: Token $GITGUARDIAN_API_KEY" \
                    -F "directory=."
                    """
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

  B. GItHub Actions
  1- For Trufflehog:
  name: CI Pipeline

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  trufflehog_scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Install Trufflehog
        run: pip install trufflehog

      - name: Run Trufflehog Secret Scan
        run: trufflehog filesystem --directory=.


 	2- For GitGuardian:
 name: CI Pipeline

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  gitguardian_scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    env:
      GITGUARDIAN_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.GITGUARDIAN_API_KEY }}

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Run GitGuardian Secret Scan
        run: |
          curl -X POST https://api.gitguardian.com/v1/scan \
          -H "Authorization: Token $GITGUARDIAN_API_KEY" \
          -F "directory=."

Note: In Github action, store GITGUARDIAN_API_KEY in setting > Secrets of the Github repository

   STEP 4: Configure Pipeline to Trigger Secret scanning
   
   
   1. Setting Up the Trigger in GitHub Actions
For GitHub Actions, i can configure my pipeline to trigger secret scanning on every commit or pull request by using events in my workflow file.

	* Create or edit the GitHub Actions workflow file:

Go to my repository on GitHub, then navigate to .github/workflows.
If there isn’t a workflow file yet, create a new file (e.g., secret-scan.yml).
Define the Trigger Events:

Add the following YAML configuration to the file:

name: Secret Scanning Workflow

on:
  push:           # Triggers on every commit
    branches:
      - main      # Specify the branch(es) you want to scan on commits (e.g., main)
  pull_request:    # Triggers on every pull request to main
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  secret_scanning:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Install Trufflehog
        run: pip install trufflehog

      - name: Run Trufflehog Secret Scan
        run: trufflehog filesystem --directory=.


   	* Commit AND PUSH
   - save and commit this workflow file to the repositoy. Every new commit or pull request targeting the specified branch (e.g, main) will now trigger a secret scanning job in the pipeline.
   
    2- SET UP the trigger in jenkins
   To set jenkins to run the secret scanning stage on each commit or pull request:
   
   * Install PLugin for Git integration:
   -> Go to Manage jenkins > Manage plugins, and install plugin like Github integration or BItbucket integration to link my repository with Jenkins.
   
   2- Create a NEW pipeline job:
   - In Jenkins, create a new pipeline job.
   - Link this job to my repositoy in the job setting (under source code management), and specify branch triggers.
   
   3- COnfigure Build triggers:
   
   - In the job configuration, scroll down to build triggers.
   - Enable Github hook trigger for GITScm polling to allow jenkins to trigger a build on each push.
   
   4- Set up Jenkinsfile with secret scanning stage:
   
    * Create or edit the Jenkinsfile in the root of my repository with the following configuration:
    
    pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Secret Scanning') {
            steps {
                script {
                    // Run Trufflehog for secret scanning
                    sh "trufflehog filesystem --directory=."
                }
            }
        }
    }

    post {
        failure {
            echo "Secrets detected! Please review."
        }
    }
}

5- Configure Webhook on GiThub:
 -> Go to my Github repository > setting > webhooks > Add webhook.
 -> In the payload URL, add my jenkins server's URL with /github-webhook/ at the end(e.g, http://your-jenkins-server/github-webhook/)
 
 -> select "just the push event" or configure it for both push and pull request events.
 
 6- Save and test:
 
 -> Commit and push change to trigger the jenkins pipeline. Each commit or pull request should now trigger the secret the secret scanning job in jenkins.
 
 3- Setting up the Trigger in Gitlab CI/CD
 
 In Gitlab CI/CD, i can configure a .gitlab-ci.yml file to automatically trigger secret scanning jobs on every commit or merge request.
 
  * In the root of my repository, create or edit the .gitlab-ci.yml file.
  
  * Add secret scanning stage:
  	- Add a stage for secret scannin as follows:
  stages:
  - secret_scanning

secret_scanning:
  stage: secret_scanning
  script:
    - pip install trufflehog
    - trufflehog filesystem --directory=.
  only:
    - branches
    - merge_requests

3- Commit and push:

-> This configuration will trigger the secret_scanning job on every branch push and merge request

 Summary of Trigger COnfigurations for Each Tool
 
 * GitHub Actions: Set up push and pull_request events in .github/workflows/secret-scan.yml.
 * Jenkins: Use GitHub webhooks to trigger on each commit or pull request, and configure Jenkinsfile with secret scanning.
 * GitLab CI/CD: Use .gitlab-ci.yml with only conditions for branches and merge_requests.

Each of these steps will ensure that secret scanning is automated in your pipeline and runs on every relevant change, helping prevent accidental exposure of secrets in your codebase.

   Step 5- Implement Notifications for Detected Secrets
   
  If secrets are detected, consider adding notifications (e.g, email, slack) for alerts.
  
  Jenkins Example (SLACK Notification)
  
  1- Install the Slack Notification plugin in jenkins and set up a slack workspace webhook.
  
  2- Add the notification step in the post section of the Jenkinsfile:
  post {
    failure {
        echo "Secrets detected!"
        slackSend (channel: '#alerts', color: '#FF0000', message: "Secret scanning failed: Secrets detected in code.")
    }
}

 GitHub Actions example(Slack Notification)
 1- Add a slack webhook in Github Actions using curl to post a message to Slack.
 
 jobs:
  notify:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Notify on Slack
        run: |
          curl -X POST -H 'Content-type: application/json' --data '{"text":"Secrets detected in the latest scan!"}' $SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL
        env:
          SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL: ${{ secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL }}

 Step 6: EDUCATE DEVELOPERS ON BEST PRACTICES FOR MANAGING SECRETS
 
 Provide guidelines to my development team for managing secrets secrets securely, such as:
 
 -> Using environment variables instead of hardcoding secrets.
 -> Storing SECRETS IN SECURE VAULTS LIKE aws secrets MaNAGER OR Hashicorp Vault.
 
 By following these steps, i can effectively integrate automated secret scanning into my CI/CD pipeline, ensuring that sensitive data is protected and reducing the risk of exposure in my codebase.
 
 VII: CONFIGURE NOTIFICATIONS AND LOGGING
 GOAL: Ensure that key stakeholder are informed of critical findings and maintain a secure audit trail of pipeline activities.
 
 THis example will focus on Jenkins, Github Actions, and GITLAB ci/cd
 
 1- Setting Up Notifications in Jenkins
To notify stakeholder swhen specific stages fail(such as security scans), jenkins allows integrration with various channels, including email, Slack.

 Step 1: Configure Email notification in jenkins
 
 * install Email Extension Plugin:

->Go to Manage Jenkins > Manage Plugins.
->Install Email Extension Plugin and Mailer Plugin (if not already installed).

 * Set Up Email Configuration:

->Go to Manage Jenkins > Configure System.
->In the Extended E-mail Notification section, configure SMTP server details (e.g., Gmail SMTP).
->Set default recipient, subject, and content. Save changes.

Configure Job-Level Notifications:

->In your job’s configuration, scroll to the Post-build Actions section.
->Choose Editable Email Notification and specify the recipient list, subject, and body.
->Set up triggers for the email (e.g., send email on build failure).

Step 2: Configure Slack Notifications in Jenkins
 * Install Slack Notification Plugin:

-> Go to Manage Jenkins > Manage Plugins.
-> Install the Slack Notification Plugin.

  * Create Slack Integration:

->In Slack, go to Apps > Manage Apps and search for Jenkins CI.
-> Configure Jenkins settings in Slack and get the Webhook URL.
  
  * Set Up Slack in Jenkins:

-> Go to Manage Jenkins > Configure System.
-> Find the Slack section and add the Webhook URL.
-> Configure default channels and notifications.


   * Add Slack Notification to Your Job:

->  In your job configuration, go to Post-build Actions and select Slack Notifications.

->Configure notifications based on build result (e.g., failure alerts).

 	  
 Next:Setting Up Notifications in GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions supports notifications through GitHub API integrations and external notifications with webhooks.

Step 1: Set Up Email Notifications in GitHub Actions

Configure Workflow File:
	->Open .github/workflows/ci.yml in your repository.

	->Add an if condition to notify users if a critical test fails:
	
	name: CI Pipeline

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Run Security Tests
        run: ./security_tests.sh
        continue-on-error: true

      - name: Send Notification on Failure
        if: failure()
        run: echo "Security test failed" | mail -s "Security Alert" you@example.com


 NEXT: Set Up Slack Notifications with GitHub Actions

   1-Create a Slack Webhook:

-> Go to Slack App Settings > Webhooks and create a new Incoming Webhook.

   2- Add Slack Notification Step to Workflow File:

Update your GitHub Actions file with Slack Webhook notifications:	        
	jobs:
  notify:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Send Slack Notification
        if: failure()
        env:
          SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL: ${{ secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL }}
        run: |
          curl -X POST -H 'Content-type: application/json' --data \
          '{"text":"Pipeline failed for ${{ github.repository }} at ${{ github.sha }}"}' \
          $SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL


 NEXT. Setting Up Notifications in GitLab CI/CD

GitLab CI/CD provides options for notifications using emails and webhooks.

Step 1: Enable Email Notifications in GitLab CI/CD

Set Up GitLab Email Notifications:

-> Go to Settings > Notifications in GitLab.

-> Configure notifications based on your project or group.

  Next: Set Up Job-Level Notifications in .gitlab-ci.yml:

Add an after_script section to send email notifications on failures:
    	
stages:
  - test

security_test:
  stage: test
  script:
    - ./security_tests.sh || echo "Security test failed" | mail -s "Alert" you@example.com


  NEXT: Configure Slack Notifications in GitLab CI/CD

	-Create Slack Webhook:

->Go to Slack App Settings and generate a Webhook URL.

-> Configure Webhook in .gitlab-ci.yml:

-> Add Slack webhook notifications in your GitLab pipeline configuration:

slack_notification:
  script:
    - curl -X POST -H 'Content-type: application/json' --data '{"text":"Security test failed"}' $SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL
  only:
    - failures

 
  NEXT:Setting Up Logging in Jenkins

Keeping audit logs is crucial for tracking actions and maintaining security.

Step 1: Install Audit Trail Plugin in Jenkins

->Install the Audit Trail Plugin:

-> Go to Manage Jenkins > Manage Plugins.

-> Search and install the Audit Trail Plugin.

 next:Configure Audit Trail Settings:

->Go to Manage Jenkins > Configure System.

Find the Audit Trail section and specify log storage location (e.g., /var/log/jenkins/audit.log).

Enable User Action Logging:

 NEXT:Set up configurations to log job creation, deletion, and any config changes.

-> Review logs periodically for auditing purposes.

Step 2: Integrate with ELK Stack for Centralized Logging (Optional)

  NEXT: Set Up ELK Stack:

-> Deploy Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana for centralized log management.

->Configure Jenkins to Send Logs to Logstash:

 -> Add a Logstash plugin to Jenkins and configure it to forward logs to Logstash.

->Visualize logs in Kibana for easy monitoring and troubleshooting.

5. Setting Up Logging in GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions automatically logs all pipeline activity, which can be viewed under Actions in your repository.

I can export logs periodically by using the GitHub API to save logs for auditing.

6. Setting Up Logging in GitLab CI/CD

GitLab CI/CD also logs all pipeline activity, which is accessible in the CI/CD > Jobs section.

I can use the GitLab API to export logs or integrate with external logging solutions by pushing logs to an ELK stack or another centralized logging system.


By following these steps, my CI/CD pipeline is fully equiped to notify stakeholder of critical vulnerabilities and maintain a secure audit trail for continuous security and compliance. tHIS SETUP improve awareness, minimizes risks, and enables rapid response to security issues.


VIII: TEST AND REFINE THE PIPELINE.
 GOAL: Verify that the CI/CD pipeline runs smoothly and effectively identifies security issues
 
 To add Testing and refinement on my CICD pipeline, i will follow these step-by-step instructions. This wilL ensure my pipeline is stable, effective, and identifies security issues accuratly. These instructions apply broadly but can be tailored to jenkins, Gitlab CI/CD, Github Actions.
 
 1- RUN A FULL PIPELINE TEST.
 
 After configuring all stage of my CICD pipeline (Build, test, security check, notifications), it's time to run a full test to comfirm that each stage is functioning properly.
 
  Step 1: Push a Test code update.
  
   1- I make a minor change in my code repository (e.g, change a file or add a comment).
   
   2- Push the change to trigger the CI/CD pipeline.
   
   	* Github actions: Push to the main branch or create a pull request
   	* Jenkins: Ensure that the webhook is configured to start the job automatically or trigger the Job manually.
   	* Gitlab CI/CD: Push to a branch configures for the pipeline(e.g main or dev).
   	
   Step 2: I Monitor each pipeline stage
   
    1- I open the CI/CD dashboard
    * Github Actions: I go to Actions in my repository
    * Jenkins: I go to the job and view the build history.
    * Gitlab CI/CD: I go to CI/CD > Pipelines.
    
   2- I watch the output for each stage (build, test, security scans, etc.).
   
   3- I check for successfull completion of each stage and confirm that logs and notifications are generated as expected.
   
   
   II- I Address any issues
   
 During the test, if any issues arise (e.g, unexpected failures, missing notification, configuration errors), troubleshoot and resolve them.
 
 Step 1: Review logs and error Message.
 
    * In each CI/CD tool, detailed logs are available:
    	-> GiTHub actions: I click on failing job and review logs for each step
    	
    	-> Jenkins: I access console Output for the job.
    	
    	-> GitLab ci/cd: I click on the job and review the job log.
    	
 * I take note of any errors, warning or misconfigurations, particularly in:
 	* Security scanning stage (eg. SAST,DAST)
 	* Notification integrations (Slack, email, etc)
 	* Container scanning or secret detection
 	
  Step2: I Modify configuration or scripts as Needed
  
  * If there are specific issuess:
  	-> I Update threshoLds values: For example, adjust acceptable vulnerability levels for SAST or DAST.
  	
  	-> I fix environment variables: I make sure any variables used for authentication or notification are correcty set up.
  	
  	-> I Tweak configurations: I adjust configurations for tools like SOnarQube or OWASP ZAP to get more accurate results
  	
  	-> I Re-run the pipeline: I push a new commit to test the refined configuration.
  	
  	
  	3- CONTINOUS IMPROVEMENT.
  	
  Once the pipeline work reliably, i plan for ongoing maintenance and improvement to adapt to new security requirements and evolving vulnerabilies
  
   Step 1: I schedule Regualar Pipeline Audits
   
   * Weekly or Monthly checks: I perform a pipeline check periodically to ensure it remains effective.
   * Team Reviews: Involve developers and security engineers in reviewing pipeline configurations to ensure that all stages are up-to-date
   
   Step 2: I update security tools as needed
   
   * Tool Updates: I regularly update the security tools (e.g, Trivy, owasp zap, SonarQube) to latest versions for better vulnerability coverage.
   
   * Add New stages: I consider adding more stages or tools if new types of vulnerabilities or testing tools become relevant.
   
   Step 3: I refine NOtifications and Logs
   
   	* I Adjust notifications: I periodically review notification settings to prevent alert fatigue (e.g, notify only on critical issues)
   	
   	* I Enhance logging: I ensure that logs are securely stored and easily accessible for audit purposes.
   	
   Step 4: I maintain Documentation
   
   * I document changes, setting, and any known execptions. This helps teams understands pipeline configurations and makes future adjustements easier.
   
   4- Verify Pipeline Stability and Efficiency
   
 After making changes or updates, i run another full pipeline test to ensure everything is working smoothly.
 
   * Push test updates: I make another small change to the code an push it to trigger the pipeline.
   
   * COmfirm stage completion: I check each stage for successful completion without errors.
   
   * Assess Performance: I comfirm that the pipeline runs efficiently and completes in an acceptable timeframe whitout unnecessary delays.
   
   EXAMPLE CI/CD PIPELINE CONFIGURATION SUMMARY (GITHUB ACTIONS)
   
   Below is a simplified example .yml configuration file to summarize the pipeline setup for Github Actions:
   
   name: CI Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Build
        run: make build

  sast_scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build
    steps:
      - name: Run SAST (SonarQube)
        run: sonar-scanner

  dast_scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: sast_scan
    steps:
      - name: Run DAST (OWASP ZAP)
        run: zap-cli scan http://localhost:8080

  container_scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: dast_scan
    steps:
      - name: Run Container Scan (Trivy)
        run: trivy image myapp:latest

  secret_scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: container_scan
    steps:
      - name: Run Secret Scan (GitGuardian)
        run: ggshield scan

  notify:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: failure()
    steps:
      - name: Notify on Failure
        run: echo "Pipeline failed" | mail -s "Pipeline Alert" you@example.com


 Summary:
 1- Run Test: Push code updates and monitor each stage.
 2- Address issues: Troubleshoot and fix any issues identified in logs
 3-  Continuous improvement: Regularly review, update, and improve the pipeline.
 4- Verify stability: RUn pipeline test after every change to confirm stability and effectiveness.
 
 By following this approach i keep my CI/CD pipeline reliable, secure, and capable of detecting vulnerabilties accuratly.
    
    
 VIIII: DOCUMENT AND SHARE THE PIPELINE PROCESS
    GOAL: provide clear documentation to help team members understand the CI/CD pipeline, including security configurations and remediation step.
    
    Step 1: I write a comprehensive README
    
   A detailed README file should be the central document for my cicd pipeline, covering each aspect so team member can easily understand and use it. Include the following sections:
   
   1- Introduction
   	* Purpose: Briefly describe the purpose of the CICD pipeline and its components (e.g, automated tests, security scans).
   	
   	* Goal: Highlight how the pipeline supports secure and efficient application delivery.
   	
   2- PIpeline stage
    	* List and explain each stage in the pipeline (e.g build, test, SAST, DAST, container scanning, deployment)
    	
    For each stage, i provide:
    
    -> Overview: Describe its role in the pipeline.
    -> Tools: List tools used (eg.SOnarQUBE FOR sast, OWASP for DAST).
    
    -> Configuration: Include any relevant configuration details, especially for security tools.
    
    EXAMPLE:
  # Example YAML configuration snippet for the stage
  
  3- Tool configuration
  
  * I include specific configurations for tools like SOnarQube, Trivy, or OWASP zap.
  
  * Details paramaters, thresholds, or setup instructions so team members understand how each tool contributes to security checks.
  
  EXAMPLE:
  # Example SonarQube config
sonar.projectKey=my_project
sonar.organization=my_org
sonar.host.url=https://sonarcloud.io

4- Security scanning and notifications

* Outline the process for handling security vulnerabilities, such as interpreting scan results and responding to critical findings.

* I describe the notification system in place (.Slack, email) and the alert criteria for security issues.

5- Best Practices.

* I share best practices for using the ci/cd pipeline, such as managing secrets, maintaining code quality, and adhering to secure coding practices.

 6- Troubleshooting guide
 
 * I offer common solution for pipeline issues (e.g, failed security scans, configuration errors).
 
 * I mention error codes or logs that could help troubleshoot issues quickly.
 
 7- Contribution guidelines (optional)
 
 * If team members need to update or modify the pipeline, i outline step for safety contributing changes.
 
 CREATE THE README FILE.
 * I use Markdown format ( README.md) for clarity.
 * Host the README in the root of my code repository so it's easily accessible to everyone.
 
 Step 2: I provide training for team members.
 
 In a real-world scenario, documentation alone isn't enough. Training session help team members understand how to interact with the pipeline and maintain best practices.
 
  1- Hold initial training sessions
  	* Audience: Developers, QA, and Devops engineers who will work with the pipeline.
  	
  	* CONTENT:
  	-> Walk through the README document, explaining each stage and the purpose of each tool.
  	
  	-> I demonstrate how to interpret security scan results and what actions to take for common vulnerabilities.
  	
  	-> I show how to handle notifications and follow up on security alerts.
  	
        * HANDS-ON COMPONENT:
  I provide a test scenario where they can observe and troubleshoot a simulated pipeline failure, focusing on security remedietion.
  
  2- I offer follow-up or refresher  training
  
  * I schedule regular training (e.g, every 6 months) to reinforce best practice and familize the team with any pipeline updates or new security tools.
  
  * For new team members, i provide a one-on-one orientation on using the pipeline.
  
  
  Step 3: I review and Update documentation regularly.
 
 As the pipeline evolves, it's essential to keep the documentation accurate and current. This also helps maintain compliance and transparency in real-world environments.
 
 1- Set Up a Regular Documentation Review Schedule

 * Every 3 to 6 months, review the README and any supplementary documentation to ensure that all configurations, tool versions, and steps are up-to-date.

 * Create a checklist for documentation review to streamline the process:
  
  ->Confirm tool versions and configurations are accurate.

  -> Update any process changes (e.g., modified thresholds for vulnerability scanning).
   -> Ensure best practices and troubleshooting steps reflect current practices.
  
  
 2- Encourage Team Feedback for Continuous Improvement

 * Invite team members to provide feedback on the documentation. They can suggest improvements or report areas that need clarification based on their experience.
 *Incorporate feedback regularly to ensure the documentation remains clear and practical.


   3- Log Changes for Traceability

* Use version control for your documentation (e.g., commit changes in Git with meaningful messages).
* Maintain a change log within the README or as a separate document to track updates to the pipeline and documentation.


     4- Communicate Changes to the Team

* When documentation is updated, notify the team about the changes (e.g., through email, Slack, or a team meeting).

* Provide a brief summary of the updates, especially if they impact how the team interacts with the pipeline.

 Summary:
 
 THis approach ensure that my CI/CD pipeline documentation is a living resource, providing team members with the knowledge and tools they need to use the pipeline effectively in a real-world environmnent.
